# Accessibility & Accommodation Configurations

Each Smarter Balanced software component may make use of an Accessibility and Accommodation configuration file.  The configuration files specific to each component are braches of the master configuration and xsd files.  The branch names correspond to the software component or assessment type that the config file belongs with.
